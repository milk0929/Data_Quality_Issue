* Enhanced customer experience
* Regulatory compliance
* Data-driven insights
* Cost reduction
* Long-term data value

## Top Data Quality Problems
### 1. Inaccurate Data (Customer and Contact Data)
---
**Problem Description**:

Inaccurate data can lead to several problems and challenges across various aspects of business operations and decision-making. Data is often collected by individuals and humans are not perfect, so one of the main causes of inaccurate data is the lack of consistent standards for data collection.

**Examples**: 
* Missing or imcomplete contact information, i.e. Address, Phone number,email address
* Inconsistent and inaccurate data entry
* Inconsistent data formats

**Solutions**:
* Understand the data and find the source of common errors and clean up (i.e.address incomplete, missing secondary information; incomplete phone numbers,missing area code of phone#,etc. )
* Set and improve the data capture standards; It is crucial to evaluate data capture standards and ensure that all parties involved reach a consensus on standardized formatting and data quality controls during the data collection process.

### 2. Big Data 
---
**Problem Description**:
Big data presents a formidable challenge, primarily stemming from its fundamental mismatch with relational databases. Three main categories for big data: unstructured data(text,videos,audio), semi-structured data(email,reports,spreadsheets), and structured data(sensor data,machine data,financial models,algorithms,etc.); 

Relational databases are primarily suited for structured data, which makes them ill-equipped to handle the complexities and sheer volume of big data sources. In this context, even seemingly minor errors can have a disproportionately significant impact, often exceeding our initial expectations.

**Examples**: 
* Compounded effect from even a small errors, like incorrect courtesy title, etc. 
* Hard to keep pace with the volume of data collected
  
**Solutions**:
* Understanding the context and relevance of each data type to ensure the data qulity
* Make sure the data shows a more complete picture in a meaningful and relevant way

### 3. Duplicate or Obsolete Data
---
**Problem Description**:
In today's dynamic landscape, data, including customer information, is rarely static and constantly changes. Maintaining up-to-date data is imperative for companies to enhance customer satisfaction. However, achieving effective data verification becomes a significant challenge for companies, particularly when data collection spans across multiple stages and channels.

**Examples**: 
* Customer change their name, address,contact preferences everyday
* Customer may receive multiple mailings with different names

**Solutions**:

* Data quality stewardship
* Use duplicate identification tools when there has multiple records for the same customer in a database or data warehouse


### 4. Compliance Issues
---
**Problem Description**:

Data quality compliance issues encompass the challenges associated with meeting regulatory requirements and industry standards to ensure accurate, reliable, and secure data. Non-compliance can lead to legal, financial, and reputational repercussions for organizations. It is crucial for companies to address these issues to maintain data integrity and meet their obligations

**Examples**: 

* Data Security standards
* Potential data leaks
  
**Solutions**:

* Consolidating privacy and security compliance management
* Centralized data security and data quality monitoring procedures
validated by an auditor



### 5. Reconciling Data Quality Issues During a Merger
---
**Problem Description**:

During a data merger or acquisition, the consolidation of disparate source systems into a centralized or expanded data warehouse environment becomes essential. 

Subsequently, the integrated data is typically funneled downstream into a comprehensive business analytics solution or a series of business intelligence solutions tailored to each business segment, and business analytics are determined by the quality of the data. 

However, a notable data quality challenge arises in this scenario, as attributing transactions to a single source becomes difficult due to the presence of multiple data source systems. 

**Examples**: 
  
* Reconciling two systems with the same record, and same information is recorded twice. 
* Reconciling inconsistent data and rise data quality issue


**Solutions**:

* Careful planning during the design phase and data integration effort at the start of a merger.
* Have a consistent set of business rules applied consistently to source data
* Implement proper data cleansing and data profiling early in the process


### 6. Inaccurate Transaction Data
---
**Problem Description**:

The volume of transaction data increases as the frequency of data exchanged between systems and databases in real-time rises. This growth in data brings about immediate results and enables real-time analysis, which are advantageous. 

However, it becomes a cause for concern when underlying data quality issues arise. Even seemingly insignificant issues like duplicate data or records can escalate into significant data integrity problems

**Examples**: 

* When financial reports show quarterly expenses or income
  
**Solutions**:

* The data warehouse team should work with analysts to establish clear definitions for each data element


### 7. Data Integrity and Operational Productivity 
---
**Problem Description**:

High-quality data can then be used for marketing automation
and personalization, sales, and loyalty programs. However, when data integrity is questionable, the data stalls decision-making and productivity, becoming costly and possibly detrimental.

**Examples**: 

* Productivity decreases in instances of lost products and time due to reprocessing an order shipped to an outdated address, or an increase in time spent flagging and fixing invalid records.

**Solutions**:

* Data quality process should be wellstructured and include a repeatable process that defines specific requirements for ‘good data.’
* Establish rules for certifying the quality of the data. These
rules should be worked into the existing data quality process and be continually amended as new data types are added.


### 8. Growth and Expansion Impacts
---
**Problem Description**:

It is common to combine internal data with data from third-party applications and external systems in a company. And data quality issues at this level could misdirect growth plans with the potential for lost opportunities and misguided resource allocation. 


**Examples**: 

* Limited internal data and the company is looking for the third-party external data
  
**Solutions**:

* Same as the solution in merger and acquisition, use data enrichment tools can help merge data sources and support the manual effort


### 9.Who is responsible for the data quality issue? 
---
**Problem Description**:

Establishing clear ownership for data quality presents a challenge since no individual business unit holds complete responsibility for all data across an enterprise. Data is pervasive, touching every corner of the company, and ensuring its quality necessitates collaboration across organizational boundaries. This interdependence often leads to complexities, making it challenging to track and assign clear quality responsibilities


**Examples**: 

* The issue of data quality responsibility arises because no single business unit is solely accountable for maintaining accurate and up-to-date customer data
*  A multinational corporation with various departments such as sales, marketing, finance, and customer service. Each department maintains its own set of databases and systems to manage their respective operations. However, these systems are not interconnected, and data is often exchanged through manual processes or periodic data transfers.
  
**Solutions**:

* Data governance leads should be selected early in any enterprise data
management initiative.
* It’s important to assign responsibilities and formal procedures for
each data governance lead and everyone that handles data.


### 10. Using Flawed Data
---
**Problem Description**:

Imperfect data always exist and it is a challenge to determine if the data quality is good enough for using. And the measurement of 'good enough' for the data quality depends on the way of using the data. 

**Examples**: 

* The accuracy and completeness of customer information may be good enough for customer communication, but not enough for the future profitability prediction. 


**Solutions**:

* It’s important to see the big picture and set realistic goals and an iterative approach to any data quality initiative.
* Determine what the data is used for, compared to the time and resources needed to make it perfect
* When it comes to data quality, enterprises should strive for improvements, not perfection.
